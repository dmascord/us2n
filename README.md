# micropython ESP8266/ESP32/Raspberry Pi Pico UART to TCP bridge

A micropython server running on an ESP8266/ESP32/Raspberry Pi Pico which acts as a bridge
between UART and TCP (LAN/WLAN).

## Installation

Follow steps to install *esptool* and *micropython for ESP8266/ESP32*.

For RPi Pico, follow *Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico*.

Then...

* clone me, oh please, clone me!

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com/tiagocoutinho/us2n
```

### Configuration

* Create a file called `us2n.json` with a json configuration for Hardware UART:

```python

import json

config = {
    "name": "SuperESP32",
    "verbose": False,
    "wlan": {
        "sta": {
            "essid": "<name of your access point>",
            "password": "<password of your access point>",
        },
    },
    "bridges": [
        {
            "tcp": {
                "bind": ["", 8000],
            },
            "uart": {
                "port": 1,
                "baudrate": 9600,
                "bits": 8,
                "parity": None,
                "stop": 1,
            },
        },
    ],
}

with open('us2n.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(config, f)

```

**Note: if you are running us2n on an ESP32, specifying rx and tx pins is supported on hardware UART.**

* Or, create a file called `us2n.json` with a json configuration for SoftUART:

```python

import json

config = {
    "name": "SuperESP32",
    "verbose": False,
    "wlan": {
        "sta": {
            "essid": "<name of your access point>",
            "password": "<password of your access point>",
        },
    },
    "bridges": [
        {
            "tcp": {
                "bind": ["", 8000],
            },
            "uart": {
                "type": "SoftUART",
                "tx": 12,
                "rx": 14,
                "timeout": 20,
                "timeout_char": 10,
                "port": 1,
                "baudrate": 9600,
                "bits": 8,
                "parity": None,
                "stop": 1,
            },
        },
    ],
}

with open('us2n.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(config, f)

```

#### Password authentication

You can also enable password authentication on connection by adding this under a bridge:

```

"auth": {
    "password": "<password prompted on connection>",
},

```

#### SSL

SSL can be enabled by adding this under a bridge:

```

"ssl": {
    "server_hostname": "<hostname>",
    "key": "/server.key.der"
    "cert": "/server.crt.der",
    "cadata": "/client.crt.der"
}

```

The keys and certificates can be generated via `gencerts.sh`.
hostname should match the hostname that socat connects to and this also needs to match
the CN of the server certificate.

This is tested on the RPi Pico. There are indications that the arguments to
ussl.wrap\_socket may vary depending on micropython implementation, as these are not the
arguments that are documented elsewhere; instead of key and cert, keyfile and certfile
might be needed on other systems. key, cert and cadata are loaded from files, no such
handling excepts for other argument names

So, look up and experiment with what arguments that ussl.wrap\_socket has on your
particular micropython implementation.

### Running

* Include in your `main.py`:

```python
import us2n
server = us2n.server()
server.serve_forever()
```

An example `main.py` for the RPi Pico is included as `picomain.py`, which
waits for 5 seconds and unless BOOTSEL is pressed, the server is started.

* Load the newly created `us2n.json` to your MCU (ESP8266/ESP32/RPi Pico)

* Load `us2n.py` to your MCU

* Load `main.py` to your MCU

* Press reset

The server board should be ready to accept requests in a few seconds.


## Usage

Now, if, for example, your MCU UART is connected to a SCPI device,
you can, from any PC:

```bash
$ nc <MCU Wifi IP> 8000
*IDN?
ACME Instruments, C4, 122393-2, 10-0-1

```
* Using socat to bridge back to a tty
```bash
$ socat pty,link=$HOME/dev/ttyV0,b9600,waitslave tcp:<MCU Wifi IP>:8000
```
* Connect to the virtual tty with miniterm.py
```bash
$ miniterm.py dev/ttyV0 9600
```
Or use screen!
```bash
$ screen dev/ttyV0 9600
```
That's all folks! Unless you want SSL:

## SSL usage

You can test the connection via openssl's s\_client:

```bash
$ openssl s_client -connect <MCU CN>:8000 -cert client.pem -CAfile server.crt
```

But to get a proper tty, use socat:

```bash
$ socat pty,link=$HOME/dev/ttyV0,b9600,waitslave OPENSSL-CONNECT:<MCU CN>:8000,cert=client.pem,cafile=server.crt
```

Then use miniterm.py or screen as before.

Note that the IP/hostname that you use to connect to the MCU needs to match the server
certificate's CN, although this can be turned off by adding ```,verify=0```.
